    "The modeling task is formulated as a supervised multi-class classification problem, where the goal\n",

    "Spotify audio features and related metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several candidate classification algorithms were considered. Multinomial logistic regression was\n",
    "identified as a simple and interpretable baseline, but its assumption of linear decision boundaries\n",
    "limits its ability to capture complex relationships between audio characteristics. Support Vector\n",
    "Machines were also considered due to their strong theoretical properties, however they require\n",
    "careful feature scaling and can be computationally expensive for larger datasets. Decision Trees\n",
    "offer non-linear modeling capabilities and interpretability, but are known to be prone to overfitting\n",
    "when used as single estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest classifier was selected as the primary algorithm for the experiments. As an\n",
    "ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees trained on bootstrap samples with randomized\n",
    "feature selection, Random Forests effectively reduce variance while preserving the ability to model\n",
    "non-linear relationships and interactions between features. This is particularly suitable for the\n",
    "Spotify dataset, where popularity is influenced by complex combinations of audio attributes such as\n",
    "energy, danceability, tempo, and acousticness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Random Forests are robust to noise and outliers, require minimal assumptions about the\n",
    "underlying data distribution, and perform well with heterogeneous feature types. These properties\n",
    "make the algorithm well suited for exploratory and predictive modeling in a Business Intelligence\n",
    "context, where robustness, stability, and reproducibility are prioritized over highly specialized\n",

    "The RandomForestClassifier exposes several hyperparameters that influence model complexity,\n",
    "generalization behavior, robustness to noise, and computational cost. Prior to selecting a\n",
    "parameter for tuning, multiple hyperparameters were examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter n_estimators controls the number of trees in the ensemble. Increasing this value\n",
    "generally improves prediction stability but also increases training time, while performance\n",
    "improvements typically plateau beyond a certain number of trees. The max_features parameter\n",
    "determines how many features are considered at each split and influences the diversity of trees\n",
    "within the ensemble; although relevant in high-dimensional settings, it is often secondary once\n",
    "sufficient feature interactions are captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf act as regularization mechanisms by limiting\n",
    "tree growth. Higher values enforce smoother decision boundaries and can reduce overfitting,\n",
    "particularly in the presence of noise or outliers. The class_weight parameter was also considered\n",
    "to address potential class imbalance by re-weighting misclassification penalties, which can improve\n",
    "macro-averaged evaluation metrics. The bootstrap parameter controls whether bootstrap sampling is\n",
    "applied and is typically left at its default value, as it rarely serves as the primary tuning\n",
    "dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these options, max_depth was selected as the most relevant hyperparameter for tuning.\n",
    "The max_depth parameter directly controls the complexity of individual decision trees: shallow\n",
    "trees may underfit complex, non-linear relationships between audio features, while very deep trees\n",
    "increase the risk of overfitting and computational cost. Tuning max_depth therefore provides a\n",
    "transparent and effective way to balance predictive performance, generalization, and training\n",
    "efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The max_depth parameter is evaluated over a small set of discrete values representing increasing \n",
